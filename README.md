This project explores the use of Deep Belief Networks (DBN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for asset price prediction. It begins with collecting data for the Dow Jones 30 from Yahoo Finance, preprocessing it, and calculating technical indicators. Two models are then trained: the first predicts the next day's Adjusted Close value, and the second predicts the next day's OHLC values. A simulation mechanism is implemented to analyze the interaction between these models. For portfolio optimization, both Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and an algorithmic trading strategy using ranked-weighted returns are employed. The MPT-based approach uses CVXPY for convex optimization, defining an efficient frontier and plotting the maximum Sharpe portfolio. The algorithmic trading strategy, on the other hand, calculates quarterly returns, ranks stocks, and assigns weights based on these rankings, constructing an initial portfolio with the top 10 stocks. The project compares DBN+LSTM with Ridge and XGBoost models, demonstrating that DBN+LSTM performs the best in terms of SMAPE, EVS, MAE, MSLE, MSE, and R-squared.
